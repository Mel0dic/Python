Input and compares two numbers, then outputs 1 if they are the same of 0 if they are different (4 marks) -----------
Input a number.  The program then loops from that number down to zero, in iterations of 1. (e.g if five is input, the program would output  5,4,3,2,1,0) (6 marks)

Take screen prints of each program and copy the LMC code in to a single document.  Save the file as a PDF and upload for marking.
Remember to included comments in the code, the task number and your name at the start of the document.
